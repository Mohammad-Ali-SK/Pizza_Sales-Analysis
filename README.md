🔹SQL Project: Advanced Data Insights for Pizza Sales🔹

Excited to share my recent work on SQL queries for a comprehensive data analysis project. I tackled a range of questions covering basic, intermediate, and advanced SQL tasks to generate actionable insights from pizza sales data. Here’s a summary of what I achieved:

📊 Basic Analysis:
Calculated total orders and revenue, identified top-selling pizzas and most common sizes, and listed popular pizza types.

🔍 Intermediate Analysis:
Leveraged joins to assess category-wise pizza quantities, analyzed order distributions by hour, and calculated daily averages to observe sales patterns.

🚀Advanced Analysis:
Determined revenue contributions by pizza type, conducted cumulative revenue analysis, and identified top-performing pizzas within each category.

This project sharpened my SQL skills in data extraction, aggregation, and analysis, preparing me for even more complex data-driven challenges. Excited to apply these skills further in my journey!
